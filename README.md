**Instructions**

Hey everyone, here is the template app that we'll use for the rest of class. All the step-by-step instructions are in the class presentation, but the overall process is:

1. **Fork** this repo into your GitHub account. 
2. **Clone** that forked repository to Nitrous. 

Welcome to GitHub!
